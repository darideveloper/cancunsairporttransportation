# Proposal: Create Booking Form Structure

## Goal
Implement the core HTML structure of the booking form using isolated React components. The form will include specific fields (Location, Date, Time, Passengers) and configuration toggles (Trip Type, Currency), ensuring all text is internationalized.

## Scope
- **Components**: Create individual React components for each field and control group.
- **Translations**: Add necessary keys to the translation system.
- **Structure**: Focus solely on semantic HTML structure; no CSS styling.
- **Logic**: Components will contain internal logic but no external state management (Store) for this iteration.

## Impact
This establishes the structural foundation for the main booking widget, ensuring accessibility and component modularity from the start.
