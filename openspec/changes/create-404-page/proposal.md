# Create 404 Page

## Goal
Create a branded, user-friendly 404 "Not Found" page that guides users back to navigation when they encounter a broken link.

## Context
Currently, the application lacks a custom 404 page (or relies on the default), which breaks the user journey and immersion. The user requested a branded page with a logo and a "back" link.

## Scope
- Create `src/pages/404.astro`.
- Ensure it reuses existing layouts and components.
- Implement proper SEO and accessibility tags.
