# Update Private Details Translations

## Problem
The current content for the Private Airport Transfer Details section described in `src/components/organisms/PrivateDetails.astro` relies on translation keys `pages.privateAirportTransfer.privateDetails` which contain outdated or placeholder text. The user has provided specific, final marketing copy for both English and Spanish versions, including updated prices and descriptions.

## Solution
Update the translation files (`src/messages/en.json` and `src/messages/es.json`) with the provided text for the `privateDetails` key.

## Risks
None. This is a content-only change to JSON files.
