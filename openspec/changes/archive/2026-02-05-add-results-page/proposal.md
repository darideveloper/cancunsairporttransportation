# Add Results Page

## Summary
Implement a new results page accessible via `/results` and `/es/resultados` to serve as a placeholder for future functionality.

## Background
The user requested a new page for displaying results. Initially, it needs to be simple (just an H1 "Results") but integrated into the existing routing and translation system to allow for future expansion.

## Goals
- Add `/results` route for English.
- Add `/es/resultados` route for Spanish.
- Create a basic Astro component for the page.
- Ensure proper routing and component mapping.
