description: OpenSpec post details, to translate content in the page
---

I want to update the following component texts, in this specific page
Check in detail how it works the current translations system
Get the text from the next html code, in spanish and english. Be sure to extract visible text and metadata (like aria label, images alt, etc)
Be sure to only edit the translation json files
Don't create a new key in translation files, if page key already exist (check in detail before edit).
Add to the proposal all the detailed/final texts
