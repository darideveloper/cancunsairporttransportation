description: Create new component only with HTML and applaying SEO
---

I want to create a new component, with the following requirmements. By now, be sure to don't apply any styles: I want only the html strcture, keeping empty "class" to apply styles later. Important: don't add styles

Also, add the component at the bottom of the following page.

Be sure to follow the best SEO and optimziation practices, like using the corerct html tags, arial label, etc.

Also, check in too much detail all components already created, to reuse them as much as possible. If the components require icons, use ReactIcons, already installed. Create new components, only if is abasolutly required (after checking in detail the already created components).

All data of the component, should come from the translation files, in the respective place depending if is a global component (a component with the same data always) or a page component (a component with text that changes in each page). By now, use dummy data in spanish and english.
